## Amplification Principle 
- Separate input and output ports 
- Energy is transferred from DC (battery) to signal through inherent nonlinearity of the device. 


## Linear Circuits 
- Simplifies circuit analysis if circuit is linear 
- LITI
	- Linear implies we can apply superposition and homogeneity. 
	- Time-invariant states that the structure of the system does not change in time. 
	- LTI allows the design and analysis in either time or frequency domain  
- Good feedback allows for linearization of a system. 

## Time-Invariant Systems 
- Time invariant tells us that a time shift in the input signal produces an identical time shift in the output. 
- Heuristics: the structure of the system remains the same, regardless of when input is applied. 
- Relative difference of time between input and output. 

## Causality 
- System where output depends only on input at present or past. Not future. 

## Linearity 
- A linear system means its action can be described by a linear operator H 
- Superposition and homogeneity properties. 
- we can use superposition as a
