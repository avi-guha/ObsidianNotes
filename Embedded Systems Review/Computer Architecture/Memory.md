### Memory Hierarchy Levels 
- CPU Registers 
- L1 Cache 
- L2 Cache 
- L3 Cache 
- Main Memory 
- Storage 

### Cache Memory Systems 
### Cache Memory Systems 
- Cache Fundamentals 
	- Cache memory acts as a high-speed buffer between the CPU and main memory, storing copies of frequently accessed and instructions. 
- Caches are organized in multiple levels (L1, L2, L3) to balance speed and capacity. 
	- L1 Fastest, smallest 
	- L2 and L3 caches are larger but slower. 
	- These are larger but slower serving as intermediate storage between L1 and main memory. 

### Virtual memory fundamentals 
- Creates abstraction between program's logical address space and physical memory hardware. 
- Allows use to use more memory than physically available and provides memory protection and isolation between processes 
- Works by dividing address space into fixed -size pages, Can be stored in physical memory or swapped out to storage when not needed.
