## Annealing Heat Treatment Can Reverse the Effects of Work Hardening 
- Internal energy from work hardening is the energy unit length of dislocation multiplied by the dislocation density 
- Work hardening increases the internal energy within a material which is the driving force for recovery and recrystallization with annealing treatment (treatment at elevated temperature)
	- Dislocation density in an annealed material can decrease from $\rho = 10^{14} \frac{m}{m^3}$ to $\rho = 10^{10} \frac{m}{m^3}$

## Recovery + Recrystallization + Grain Growth 
- During work hardening ~ 95% of the work done in deforming a metal is converted to heat, however ~5% is stored in the metal.
- As a result, a deformed material is thermodynamically unstable
	- **it is more stable to return to the lower energy state before work hardening**
- The application of thermal energy in combination with the stored strain energy causes 
	1. Recovery
		- Recovery is the reduction in internal stress of the material due to dislocation motion as a result of enhanced atomic diffusion at elevated temperatures. Material properties partially return to its pre-worked state. 
	2. Recrystallization
	3. Grain growth

- At elevated temperatures, some dislocations 
	- (a) move and stresses are reduced during recovery. Some grain growth may also occur and will competed with recovery and recrystallization
	- Recrystallization begins (a) $\rightarrow$ (b). Crystals will nucleate at grain boundaries, or at areas of high internal stress. Crystal grain grows during (b) $\rightarrow$ (c) $\rightarrow$ (d)

## Recrystallization Temperature is Close to the cold work vs. Hot Work Temperature threshold for most pure metals.

## Three Stages of Annealing Heat Treatment
- recovery
	- Release of stored energy by dislocation motion without applied stress, due to enhanced atomic diffusion at elevated temperature
	- Restoration of physical properties to pre-cold worked state begins 
	- Dislocations reconfigure to have lower strain energy
- recrystallization 
	- Formation of new strain-free and equiaxed grains with low dislocation densities 
		- Grains are still in high-strain energy state after recovery 
		- Driving force for recrystallization is the stored internal energy 
			- Strained vs unstrained material
		- Equiaxed grain: grains have approximately equal dimensions in all directions.

## Effect of temperature on recrystallization
- Changes in strength and ductility and grain size in brass specimen when held at specified temperature for 1 hour:

## Effect of time and temperature on recrystallization 
- $\textbf{recrystallization temperature}$: the temperature at which recrystallization is complete in a specific time frame (typically one hour)
- ![[Pasted image 20251001123210.png]]
- Recrystallization temperature for this copper in one hour is ~119 $\celsius$ or ~113 $\celsius$ 

## Softening as a function of annealing temperature
![[Pasted image 20251001123751.png]]
- Key differences:
	- Initial hardness is greater with increased degree of cold work. 
	- Magnitude of decrease in hardness is greater with increased degree of cold work 
	- Recovery and recrystallization begins at a lower temperature for materials with increased degree of cold work. 
- Magnitude of reduction related to cold work why? 
	- Due to increased stored energy within the material, which acts as the driving force for recovery and recrystallization 

## Recrystallization is a thermally activated process

## Extent of cold work affects recrystallization temperature and rate
- Recrystallization temperature decreases with increasing cold work 
	- The activation energy Q for recrystallization is a decreasing function of the amount of cold work
	- The rate of recrystallization at a given temperature increases as cold work increases 
	- A **critical deformation**  exists below which recrystallization does not occur

## Recrystallization occurs more rapidly in pure metals than metal alloys 
- Recrystallization involves motion of grain boundaries as new grains nucleate and grow 
- Impurity atoms (solute) interact with grain boundaries to reduce their mobility
- This reduces crystallization rate and increases recrystallization temperature. 

## Three stages of annealing heat treatment 
1. Recovery 
2. Recrystallization 
3. Grain Growth 
	- After recrystallization grains grow to reduce grain boundaries and energy within material
	- Grain growth does not need to be preceded by recrystallization
