## Environmental degradation 
- degradation of one or more of a material properties as a result from exposure to environment 
	- degradation of steel due topwater
	- degradation of plastic due to exposure to UV light 
- Corrosion refers to continued electrochemical attack of a material normally resulting in oxidation of that metal 
- Corrosion costs 3-5% of gdp Z

## Key elements for corrosion 
- Moisture present to act as medium for ion conduction and ionic transport 
- Reduction in energy - thermodynamic driving force 
- Source of oxidant 
- Mass transport of oxidant to the metal surface 

## Corrosion of metals 
- Material is not destroyed but converted to a different form 
- The driving force is a reduction in Gibb's free energy
- ![[Pasted image 20251104204558.png]]
- Huge thermodynamic driving force $\Delta G < < 0$ for oxxidation to occur, or in essence, to return to its mineral state.

- During corrosion, an active electrochemical cell forms in which one part of the metal surface serves as the anode and the other as the cathode.

## Forms of Corrosion 
- Uniform attack 
	- Oxidation and reduction occur uniformly over surface. Volume change in the oxide can mechanically displace the oxide layer from the rest of the material, exposing more metal underneath for further corrosion. 
- Crevice Corrosion 
	- occurs between two pieces of same metal, access to oxygen restricted. 
- Intergranular Corrosion 
	- Occurs along grain boundaries often where special phases exist which are more susceptible to corrosion 
- Galvanic Corrosion 
	- Two different metals or alloys are electrically coupled while exposed to electrolyte 
	- More reactive metal acts as anode and corrodes, less reactive metal acts as cathode and protected.

- Pitting Corrosion 
	- Downward propogation of small pits and holes occurs in the metal. Stainless steels and aluminum in some environments (high salt)
- Stress corrosion
	- Stress and corrosion work together at crack tips to accelerate crack propagation and failure. 
- Erosion corrosion
	- Break down of passivating layer by erosion with abrasive two phase fluids 
- Selective Leaching 
	- Preferred corrosion of one element/ constituent  

## Galvanic Series 
- ranks the reactivity of metals and alloys in seawater at 25 C

## Galvanic vs EMF Series 
- Galvanic lists metals and alloys, EMF only metals 
- Galvanic is experimental, EMF calculated from thermodynamic principles 
- Galvanic accounts for effects of passive films, oxidation, kinetics, and environment

## Protecting against Corrosion 
1. Self formation of oxide layer 
2. Physical barriers 
3. Sacrificial or cathodic protection 

More methods 
- Reduce temperature 
- Removing reactants 
- Add inhibitors to fluids 

Self formation of a protective oxide layers
- oxide layer prevents further corrosion 
- Physical barriers 
	- Coating with non-reactive material to inhibit contact with water and oxygen.
- Sacrificial or cathodic protection 
	- Couple metal to be protected with sacrificial anode 
	- Anode can be: 
		- Made with more active metal on galvanic scale for passive protection 
		- Driven with external power source to electrically bias the electrodes correctly for protection.
