## 🔹 Point Defects
- Vacancy: missing atom.
- $( N_v/N = e^{(-Q_v/RT)} )$.
- Interstitial: atom between lattice sites.
- Substitutional impurity.

## 🔹 Line Defects (Dislocations)
- Edge: half-plane (b ⟂ line).
- Screw: shear (b ∥ line).
- Mixed.
- Burgers vector (b): slip direction.

## 🔹 Planar Defects
- Grain boundaries.
- Twin boundaries.
- Free surfaces.

## 🔹 Slip Systems
- Slip = dislocation motion.
- FCC: {111}<110>, 12 systems, ductile.
- BCC: {110},{112},{123}<111>, 48 systems, ductile at high T.
- HCP: {0001}<1120>, 3 systems, brittle.

## 🔹 Dislocation Density
- Annealed metals: ~10⁶–10⁸ m/m³.
- Cold-worked: ~10¹⁴ m/m³.
- Higher density → stronger, less ductile.

## ✅ Summary
- Defects enable plastic deformation.
- More slip systems → higher ductility.
- Strengthening occurs via dislocation interactions.
