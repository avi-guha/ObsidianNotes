## Pure iron 
- Pure iron experiences two changes in crystal structure 
- From 1394 - 1538 C it exists as a BCC phase called $\delta$ ferrite 
- From 912 - 1394 C it transforms to an FCC phase called austenite or $\gamma$ iron
	- Not stable at room temp
- Below 912 C it exists as a BCC phase called ferrite or $\alpha$ iron. 
	- soft

### Part of the Fe-Fe$_{3}C$ Phase Diagram

Only part of the phase diagram is shown (up to ~7% carbon)
	- Left axis pure iron 
	- Right axis only extends to 6.70 wt%C
This portion of the Fe-C Phase diagram is sufficient to describe all of the steels and cast irons used today 

While the graph shows wt%Carbon wt%C on the horizontal axis, we sometimes refer to it equivalently as %cementite or %Fe3C

Cementite: Fe3C is a hard, brittle material and is not used on its own.

Note: contains eutectoid composition, where a single phase solid changes instantaneously into a two phase solid.
