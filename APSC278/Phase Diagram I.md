## Phase Diagrams 
- We can plot these as temp vs. composition or pressure vs. temp. 
- Normally use temp vs. composition, since most manufacturing processes at atmospheric pressure 
- We can study phase diagrams to understand aspects of the following: 
	- Alloying and allowed mixtures of materials 
	- Heat treatments and microstructure 
	- Solidification (important during casting and welding and other fabrication methods)
	- Trends in mechanical properties in different regions of the phase diagram 
- Phase diagrams depict equilibrium conditions: 
	- Represent the system after a long period of time has elapsed, or have evolved slowly 
	- Represent how the system would behave if mass diffusion rates were infinitely fast.

## Water-salt phase diagram 
- Other observation: 
	- In this case, the lowest effective temperature for NaCl as a practical de-icer is 7 C (only 10 percent salt required to create all liquid). To go below this, there is too much salt needed to melt at lower temperatures. 
	- Below -21 C there is a permanent mix of salt and ice, 2 solid phases with no liquid present about how much salt is added. 

## Binary Isomorphous Systems 
- Binary - two elements 
- Isomorphous - roughly means that only one type of structure contained in the solid phase 
- On the next set of graphs, observe the phase changes along 0% and 100% vertical axes to see how the pure elements behave, and compare it to the vertical at any other composition. 
- Next long example: copper-nickel is a good example of an isomorphous system
	- Cu and Ni both have FCC crystal structure, nearly identical atomic radii and electronegativity values, and similar valence procures.

- Some similarity with the trend used for solid solution hardening. 

## Use of Phase Diagrams 
- Three questions can be answered from Phase Diagrams 
	- Q1. What phases are present at a given temperature and composition? 
		- Answer: Go to the temperature and composition of interest and identify the region 
	- Q2. What is the composition of each of these phases? What percentage of the elements are in each phase?
		- For a single phase regions (L and $\alpha$), composition is simply $C_{o}$
		- For a two phase region with composition $C_{0}$
			- Draw a horizontal line at temperature of interest through the point. This is called a tie line.
			- Intersection of the tie line and the phase boundaries gives the composition of each respective phase. Here, the liquid has a composition of $C_{l}$ and the solid has a composition of $C_{\alpha}$
			- Final note 
				- Overall composition at a + liquid remains at $C_o$
		- ![[Pasted image 20251104215137.png]]
	- Q3. How much is present of each phase (usually in percentage, sometimes in percentage volume)
		- Use the lever rule to predict fractions of a specific phase 
		- Based on assumption of infinite diffusion in solid and liquid and mimics the phase diagram
			- Ignore mass transfer 
			- Ignore heat transfer 
		- At a given temperature and composition, both solid and liquid have uniform composition by phase diagram 
		- Assumes infinitely high diffusion rate 
			- Mass distributed instantaneously 
## Determination of Phase Fractions 
- Draw tie line 
- Mark where tie line intersects at two phase boundaries 
- Calculate the fraction of the length of the tie line on the opposite side of the overall composition point vs. the overall tie line length. This fraction is the same as the mass fraction of each phase.

## Determination of Fractions of Each Phase, Notes 
- lever rule is derived from a calculation of mass conservation 
- There is a logic check to this. 
	- if a composition is closer to another side, it makes sense that it will have more composition of the that state.

# Equilibrium Cooling vs. Non-Equilibrium Cooling


### Equilibrium 
- Starting from liquid, process of solidification begins with nucleation of primary solid alpha phase. 
- As solid grows, there is redistribution in each phase. 
- In eq'm cooling assumed that temp changes slow, so the concentration of liquid and solid is uniform distribution 
- The solid components are actually changing composition during cooling, reducing in % nickel 
- Compositions of starting liquid and final solid are identical and uniform 
- Each final grain of alpha phase has the same final composition. 

### Non Equilibrium 
- Assume instantaneous diffusion in liquid, but very little diffusion in solid. 
- Assume little to no changes in composition in any solid material from time it initially changes from liquid to solid 
- Composition is not uniform in the solid. Centre may be more concentrated than outer regions 
- Example of microstructure grains and phase are visible with a microscope.
