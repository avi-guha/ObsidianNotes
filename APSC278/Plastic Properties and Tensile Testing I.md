## 🔹 Learning Objectives
- Describe plastic deformation in metals.
- Determine yield strength from stress–strain curves.
- Differentiate heterogeneous vs homogeneous yielding.
- Define work hardening, necking, ductility, toughness.

## 🔹 Plastic Deformation
- Permanent, irreversible.
- Begins at **yield strength (σy)**.
- **Work hardening:** stress increases as dislocation density rises.
  - Equation: $( \sigma_{true} = K \epsilon_{true}^n )$
    
- **Ultimate Tensile Strength (σUTS):** maximum stress → onset of necking.
- **Necking:** localized reduction in cross-section → leads to fracture.

## 🔹 Yielding
- **Heterogeneous yielding (steel):** Lüder’s bands due to dislocation pinning.
- **Homogeneous yielding (brass):** smooth yielding across sample.

## 🔹 Elastic Recovery
- Unloading → elastic portion recovered, plastic portion remains.
- Important for forming processes (automotive stamping, etc.).

## 🔹 Necking & Failure
- Necking starts at σUTS.
- Caused by void nucleation, growth, and coalescence.
- Typical fracture: cup-and-cone.

## 🔹 Ductility
- % elongation = (Lf – L₀)/L₀ × 100%.
- % reduction in area = (A₀ – Af)/A₀ × 100%.

## 🔹 Toughness
- Energy absorbed before fracture.
- Area under entire stress–strain curve.
- Depends on both strength & ductility.

## 🔹 Composition Effects
- Example: Carbon steel
  - ↑ Carbon → ↑ strength, ↓ ductility & toughness.

## ✅ Summary
- Plastic deformation = permanent.
- Yield strength marks onset.
- UTS = necking begins.
- Work hardening increases strength, decreases ductility.
- Toughness = total energy absorbed before fracture.
