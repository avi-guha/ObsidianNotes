## 🔹 Learning Objectives
- Distinguish engineering vs true stress/strain.
- Calculate ductility vs gauge length.
- Apply safety factors.
- Understand hardness testing.
- Use Ashby charts for design.

## 🔹 Engineering vs True Stress–Strain
- Engineering:
  - σEng = $F / A₀$
  - εEng = $ΔL / L₀$
- True:
  - σTrue = $F / Ai$
  - εTrue = ln(Li / L₀)
- Relation: $( \sigma_{True} = \sigma_{Eng}(1 + \epsilon_{Eng}) )$.
- True stress valid until necking; after necking → complex state.

## 🔹 Ductility & Gauge Length
- Percent elongation depends on sample length.
- Need standardized testing (ASTM).

## 🔹 Safety Factors
- Working stress: $( \sigma_w = \sigma_y / N )$.
- Example: steel wires supporting tower load.
- Trade-off: too high N = expensive, too low N = unsafe.

## 🔹 Hardness Testing
- Resistance to indentation.
- Quick, nondestructive.
- Correlates with strength (approx. 3×σy).
- Scales: Brinell, Rockwell, Vickers.

## 🔹 Ashby Charts
- Plot material properties (e.g. stiffness vs density).
- Useful for visual selection of optimal material.

## ✅ Summary
- Engineering vs True: engineering is conservative.
- Necking = true stress invalid.
- Safety factor ensures reliability.
- Hardness testing = strength proxy.
- Ashby charts = property trade-offs.
